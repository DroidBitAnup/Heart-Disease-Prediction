# Heart Disease Prediction System

A Machine Learning-based application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient medical attributes.  
This system helps in early detection and supports healthcare decision-making.

## Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally.  
This project uses a trained Machine Learning model to analyze medical data and predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease.

The prediction is based on important health parameters such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Level
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
